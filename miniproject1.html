        <blockquote cite="https://bobs-burgers.fandom.com/wiki/Louise_Belcher">
          <p>
            "[Louise Belcher] is the youngest member of the Belcher family. Her off-balance sense of humor and hunger for conflict makes her somewhat of a liability in the kitchen and often gets her family both into and/or out of tricky situations. Like her siblings, Gene and Tina, Louise goes to Wagstaff School, where she is a fourth grader."
